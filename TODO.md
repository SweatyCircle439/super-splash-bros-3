# TODO

## Definitely in next version
- [ ] ambient effects
- [x] drains
- [x] supply drops
- [x] deadly geysers
- [x] water now starts rising after a 1:30 because previously most games would end before the water has even started rising
- [ ] full controller compatibility

## Also in next version, but it came to mind while working on it

## Possibly in next version, if it works out well
- [ ] Local 1v1 mode with keyboard?
- [ ] Achievements
