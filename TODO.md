# TODO in v1.2.0

## Definitely in next version
- [ ] @Flawake's `isValidIP` optimalization
- New power-ups
  - [ ] Rocket Rain
  - [ ] Railgun
  - [ ] Levitation

## Also in next version, but it came to mind while working on it

## Possibly in next version, if it works out well
- [ ] Fix above-60-Hz-monitor issues
- [ ] Local 1v1 mode with keyboard?
- [ ] Achievements (perhaps too lazy to add that)
